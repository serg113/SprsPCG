# SpyPCG
Implemented in SpyPCG.m algorithm trains sparse network with conjugate gradient stepping. 
Artificial neural network composed of input layer, hidden layer and output layer.
Sparse network is constructed randomly and doesnot change quantity of connections during training process.
At every iteration weak connections are replaced with random one that was "zero" in previous step.
